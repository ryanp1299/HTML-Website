<h1>Bull Case for Palantir Stock</h1>
<p>Palantir is a software as a service company looking to change the world by offering data software for the modern enterprise. They have provided software/data services for the US 
government for several decades. Palantir is looking to bring the expertise that they have developed to the commercial market. Foundry is their product that will allow private sector
companies the ability to organize their operational data and use machine learning to help them make important decisions. With a projected 30% year over year growth rate for the next several years, I believe
this company is a buy.</p>

<p>Here is a link to an article that helps better illustrate the potential of Palantir's products.
